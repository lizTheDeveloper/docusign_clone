## 📝 Notes on Deferred Features

Features intentionally NOT in MVP to avoid scope creep:
- OAuth (can start with email/password)
- Bulk send (power feature for Phase 2+)
- API (requires stable core product first)
- Custom branding (premium tier feature)
- Mobile apps (responsive web sufficient for MVP)

These features have high value but are not critical path to initial revenue.
